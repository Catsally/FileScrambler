<h1>About</h1>
<h4>Probably the least useful tool on the internet. It gets all the file names from a folder and switches them with each other randomly</h4>

<br>

<p>Note: it only swaps file names in the exact directory you give it. it does not go into folders or swap the names of folders.</p>

<br>

<h1>ToDo</h1>
<h5>- maybe add settings to only swap certain filetypes</h5>
<h5>- rewrite the entire goddam thing so its not a janky mess</h5>
