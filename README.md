<h1>About</h1>
<h4>Probably the least useful tool on the internet. It gets all the file names from a folder and switches them with each other randomly</h4>

note: It does work with the whole "switching names out" thing. but it also removes the file extension. so until I make a system to stop that just manually add the extensions back I guess (Idk you're the idiot whos using this useless software)
